Data Royale 2025-- a datathon using information of Clash Royale's Season 18 ladder matches.

This team consists of Dinan Sooriyaarachchi, Jessica Setiadhi, Andrew Escobedo, and Andy Nguyen.

After gathering all the necessary data, we have developed a proposal for Supercell to focus on player behavior analytics for Clash Royale, including visuals that feature a predictive model of behavior tilt, which reflects the human behavior aspect as they play.

Out of 74 columns in the dataset, we selected 28 columns, some of which have been feature engineered to reflect player behavior.
